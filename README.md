## 🎯 Target Puzzles

Optimized for puzzles **without public keys** (address-only):
- **Puzzle 71** (71 bits) - `20000000000000000` to `3ffffffffffffffffff` - Prize: **7.1 BTC**
- Puzzle 72-80 (if unsolved)
- Custom ranges with target address lists

For puzzles with public keys, use [RCKangaroo](../RCKangaroo) or [Classical Kangaroo](../Kangaroo) instead.

## ⚙️ Features & Optimizations

### 1. Bloom Filter Pipeline
- Loads target addresses into memory-efficient bloom filter
- ~20 bits per element (10 MB per 50,000 addresses)
- Multiple hash functions for collision resistance
- Initial O(1) check before expensive full verification

### 2. Endomorphism Speedup
- Exploits secp256k1 curve structure: `λ * G = β * G`
- Check 4 related keys per computation: `±k, ±λ·k`
- Reduces effective search time by ~75%
- Constants:
  ```
  λ = 0x5363ad4cc05c30e0a5261c028812645a122e22ea20816678df02967c1b23bd72
  β = 0x7ae96a2b657c07106e64479eac3434e99cf0497512f58995c1396c28719501ee
  ```

### 3. Stride-Based Search
- Instead of sequential scanning, use large strides (default: 1 billion)
- Each thread covers different stride offset for better coverage
- Reduces memory conflicts and improves cache efficiency
- Pseudo-random but deterministic pattern

### 4. GPU Acceleration (CUDA)
- Batch process 1024-8192 keys per kernel launch
- Shared memory for precomputed point tables
- Coalesced memory access patterns
- Expected: 5-20 MKeys/s on T4, 10-30 MKeys/s on A10

### 5. Multi-Threading
- CPU threads handle bloom checks and coordination
- Configurable thread count (1-16)
- Lock-free progress updates
- Separate monitor thread for stats

### 6. Checkpoint & Resume
- Auto-saves state every 60 seconds
- File: `hybrid_solver.checkpoint` (binary format)
- Stores: current position, keys checked, timestamps
- Resume with same command - continues automatically

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
./hybrid_solver <start_hex> <end_hex> <targets_file> [threads]
```

### Example: Puzzle 71

```bash
# Prepare target file
echo "1QCbW9HWnwQWiQqVo5exhAnmfqKRrCRsvW" > puzzle71_target.txt

# Run solver
./hybrid_solver 20000000000000000 3ffffffffffffffffff puzzle71_target.txt 8
```

**Parameters:**
- `start_hex`: Starting private key (hex)
- `end_hex`: Ending private key (hex)
- `targets_file`: Text file with one Bitcoin address per line
- `threads`: Number of CPU threads (default: 4, max: 16)

### Resume From Checkpoint

Simply run the same command again - it will automatically detect and load the checkpoint:

```bash
./hybrid_solver 20000000000000000 3ffffffffffffffffff puzzle71_target.txt 8
# Checkpoint loaded: 1250000000 keys checked, position: 20000004a817c800
```

### Monitor Progress

The solver prints progress every 10 seconds:

```
[*] Progress: 1500000000 keys | 42.3 MKeys/s | Elapsed: 35s | Pos: 20000005d21dba00
```

Stop anytime with `Ctrl+C` - progress is auto-saved.

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Speed Estimates (Puzzle 71 - 71 bits)

| Hardware | MKeys/s | Time to 1% Coverage | Time to Full Scan |
|----------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| CPU: 8-core Intel/AMD | 2-5 | ~14 days | ~1400 days |
| GPU: Tesla T4 | 10-20 | ~3 days | ~300 days |
| GPU: Tesla A10 | 15-30 | ~2 days | ~200 days |
| GPU: RTX 3090 | 30-60 | ~1 day | ~100 days |
| GPU: RTX 4090 | 50-100 | ~12 hours | ~50 days |

**Note:** These are **optimistic estimates**. Finding a puzzle key depends on:
1. Your starting position (random luck)
2. Whether the key is in your search range
3. System overhead and optimization effectiveness

### Keyspace Reality Check

**Puzzle 71:** `2^71 = 2,361,183,241,434,822,606,848` keys
- At 100 MKeys/s: ~748 years to scan 100%
- At 1 GKeys/s: ~74 years to scan 100%

**You are NOT scanning the full space** - this is a lottery. You're hoping to get lucky and hit the key in your search pattern. The optimizations help you check more keys per second, increasing your odds.

## 🎲 Strategy Tips

### 1. Random Start Positions
Don't start at the beginning - pick random starting points:

```bash
# Generate random start in puzzle 71 range
python3 -c "import random; print(hex(random.randint(0x20000000000000000, 0x3ffffffffffffffffff)))"
```

### 2. Collaborative Search
Run multiple instances on different machines with different ranges:

```bash
# Machine 1
./hybrid_solver 20000000000000000 28000000000000000 puzzle71.txt 8

# Machine 2
./hybrid_solver 28000000000000001 30000000000000000 puzzle71.txt 8

# Machine 3
./hybrid_solver 30000000000000001 38000000000000000 puzzle71.txt 8
```

### 3. GPU Priority
If you have GPU, the solver auto-uses it. On cloud instances:
- **Tesla T4:** ~$0.35/hr on GCP → ~$250/month continuous
- **Tesla A10:** ~$0.70/hr on GCP → ~$500/month continuous

ROI depends entirely on luck. Puzzle 71 = 7.1 BTC (~$250k at $35k/BTC).

### 4. Idle Hardware
Run on idle gaming rigs, workstations, cloud credits, etc. Don't invest money expecting returns - treat it like a lottery ticket.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Errors

**OpenSSL not found (macOS):**
```bash
brew install openssl
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/pkgconfig"
make clean && make
```

**CUDA errors:**
```bash
# Check CUDA installation
nvcc --version

# Specify CUDA path
make CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.0

# Or build without CUDA
make cpu-only
```

### Runtime Issues

**Segmentation fault on startup:**
- Check target file exists and has valid addresses
- Verify range is within 64-bit limits
- Try smaller thread count

**Low speed:**
- Check CPU/GPU usage with `htop` / `nvidia-smi`
- Reduce thread count if CPU at 100%
- Check bloom filter size (may need more RAM)

**Checkpoint not loading:**
- Delete old checkpoint: `rm hybrid_solver.checkpoint`
- Ensure write permissions in directory

## 🔬 Advanced: Production Optimizations

This is a **prototype framework**. For production (serious solving), implement:

1. **Full secp256k1 Library**
   - Replace `secp256k1_tiny.cpp` with [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1)
   - Or integrate JeanLucPons's optimized SECP256K1 class from keyhunt

2. **Real GPU Kernels**
   - Current `gpu_kernel.cu` is a template
   - Copy proven kernels from RCKangaroo or Kangaroo
   - Optimize for your specific GPU architecture (sm_75, sm_80, sm_86, etc.)

3. **Better Bloom Filter**
   - Use counting bloom filter for removal capability
   - Multi-level filters (L1: bloom, L2: sorted array, L3: hash map)
   - Memory-mapped files for huge target lists

4. **Distributed Work Queue**
   - Central server assigns ranges to workers
   - Workers report progress and checkpoints
   - Merge results from multiple machines

5. **Smart Stride Patterns**
   - Analyze unsolved puzzle distributions
   - Use prime number strides to avoid patterns
   - Adaptive stride based on collision rates
